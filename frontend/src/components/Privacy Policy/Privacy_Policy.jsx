              services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to
              customize our Website to make your experience safer and easier.
              More importantly, while doing so we collect personal information

              on the Website. We may automatically track certain information
              about you based upon your behaviour on our Website. We use this
              information to do internal research on our users' demographics,
              interests, and behaviour to better understand, protect and serve
              our users. This information is compiled and analysed on an
              aggregated basis. This information may include the URL that you
              just came from (whether this URL is on our Website or not), which
              URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Website or not),
              your computer browser information, and your IP address.We use data
              collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the
              Website to help analyse our web page flow, measure promotional
              effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small
              files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our

              also help us provide information that is targeted to your
              interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they
              are automatically deleted at the end of a session. You are always
              free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in
              that case you may not be able to use certain features on the
              Website and you may be required to re-enter your password more
              frequently during a session.
